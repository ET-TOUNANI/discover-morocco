        "How do you rebuild confidence in traveling to the United States? By taking a roadtrip to all 50 states and 5 territories to tell the stories of its people. We created, United Stories, a tourism brand and marketing platform to increase visitation to the US from Brand USA’s priority international markets. Brand awareness of the US has always been high so United Stories had to focus on increasing intent to visit & conversion, whilst improving brand perception. United Stories also had to represent the hugely diverse range of tourism products available in the United States and satisfy the needs of over 900 public and private sector partners from state & city tourism boards to global hotel chains, airlines, attractions, national parks and media partners. Expanding the notion of the great American road trip, we told the story of US travel through the lens of its diverse people, cultures & geography. We shot cinematic hero films that won awards across the world, never been seen viral videos that drove millions of views online and activated branded modes of transport that garnered international press & recognition.",

    "description":
        "We transformed one of the most legendary travel brands in the world from a “bucket-list” to a “to-do-list” destination by creating the #peopletopeople campaign. Egypt is the oldest travel brand in the world. It’s been attracting visitors since Roman times and continues to be on the bucket list for many people. The country's tourism reached a peak in 2010 with almost 15 million visitors. However, the Arab Spring Revolution had since triggered a decline in the number of tourists and tourism revenues. To make matters worse, the perception of Egypt in travelers’ minds centered on pyramids and temples along a well-trodden tourist trail. This didn’t speak to their emotional needs and led to a lack of urgency to visit.",

        "How do you modernize an iconic destination? By uncovering and sharing its real soul with the world. On the map, Jamaica is a dot in the Caribbean Sea. But its impact on the world’s culture is the size of a continent. Contained in a mere 4,244 square miles, Jamaica is a cultural giant that continues to leave an indelible footprint on the world’s food, music, sport and literature. As a visitor when you’re there you live intense, one-of-a-kind, transformative experiences that you’ll remember for a lifetime. The real story of Jamaica had never been told, which meant that travelers had a very narrow view of the country: beautiful beaches, reggae and Bob Marley, all-inclusive resorts and an unsafe place. In line with the Jamaican spirit, we launched a larger-than-life global platform: JAMAICA®, Heartbeat of the World. For the first time, we showed the world the real Jamaica and everything it has to offer: hypnotic music, spiced flavors, thrilling adventures, deep chill and breathtaking nature.",

        "Promoting a new flight route to Mumbai through positive impact storytelling — building a basketball court for the local community. Air Canada is more than an airline. It’s Canada’s ambassador to the world. As Canada's global ambassador, its mission is to celebrate and promote the country's values of inclusivity, compassion, kindness and equality which have been powerfully reflected in the brand’s “Fly The Flag” creative platform. With a number of new direct routes opening between Canada and India, Air Canada wanted to generate awareness while also promoting its core brand values, driving further positive sentiment to what it means to #FlyTheFlag. To be successful, we knew we needed to walk the walk. So, we put the local Mumbai community at the heart of our storytelling and focused on giving back as a way to spark a global conversation about Air Canada. Working with Mumbai’s artists, we restored a rundown basketball court by commissioning local workers and creating a long-lasting artistic legacy. We hosted a community basketball game featuring notable figures from Indian and Canadian culture and sports as well as local children to open the court. We then documented these moments on social and digital media in real-time and curated for future distribution across all marketing channels including Air Canada’s inflight entertainment.",

        "Billed as the highest-profile attraction Dubai has ever launched, Ain Dubai needed a ground-breaking campaign to get the world's attention and drive sales. We created an adrenaline fueled, fly-through experience using proprietary first person view drone technology to showcase the attraction and its surrounding food, beverage and entertainment outlets. We used cutting edge super slow motion videography to capture unique personal moments of key product offerings provided in Ain pods and followed the journey of a young couple enjoying all the experience has to offer. Using multidisciplinary teams of drone pilots, mobile phone shooters, cinematic videographers and photographers we created content for every marketing outlet Ain Dubai could be on with a fully integrated distribution strategy that launched content on Beautiful Destinations social channels at the same time as paid, partner and influencer activity driving awareness across the globe and supporting the brands owned social, out of home, TV & Radio and IRL activations.",
